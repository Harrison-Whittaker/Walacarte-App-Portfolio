**Walacarte Mobile Application (code sample)**

Welcome! This repository contains a sample for my mobile application, Walacarte. Walacarte is an app that helps organize your recipes, create shopping lists, and draft meal plans. The app was created using modern best practices (MVVM, Jetpack Compose, Coroutines, Room, and Unit/UI testing using JUnit and MockK).

The application is currently available for review via a closed testing track on the Google Play Store. To receive an invitation to download/test the app, please email me at harrisonwhittaker.dev@gmail.com

Note: This is a sample of Walacarte's code; the complete source code is maintained via a private GitHub repository.

**Future Features**
- Landscape Support for View Recipe Screen
- New Pantry/Inventory screen for ingredients you may already have in your kitchen
- Ingredient support for Quick List
- Dedicated Meal Plan creator
- Recipe Importer
- Much, much more
